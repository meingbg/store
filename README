Introduction:
"store" is a file storage and backup solution. Features include file and block level deduplication as well as compression.

Internally it has some resemblance to how git works, although with some differences:
- It's designed to store files, not code. No merging, forking, diffing, branching etc.
- Contrary to git it saves everything, including empty directories.
- Saves and restores all file and directory properties: owner, group, all 9 permission settings, modification time, access time, file name and content.
- Automatically applies file level duplication and compression when storing things in a repository. Block level deduplication is available on demand.
- Slower than git although optimization is on the todo list. As a backup or storage system, speed is not as high a priority as it would be for a productivity tool.

Usage:
