function for listing all paths in repo to a certain hash
cache for settings and statistics
set command for settings, e.g. what to store
in repo, folders: obj, (tmp/)cac(he), tmp, sys for list and settings
extract certain folder, browser?
Possibility to comment objects based on hash (weather or not they're in the repository?)
Restoring atime in save operation, otherwise all directory/file objects will change over time and bloat the repo
optimize nodes-referenced in gc to be breadth-first
is deduplication doing everything twice? what happens when three (more than two) files in a row have the save prefix?

yep, look in the log for 712cad08015f5577.. it is replaced two times consecutively
prefix deduplication is chewing too much binary zeroes. How can it be fixed? Is it even good in the first place?
Maybe it would help just setting prefixl a lot higher, like perhaps 5MiB instead of 1KiB
Considering the extra storage space for .cat files along with gzip performance on null data, 5MiB seems like a good prefixl value.
